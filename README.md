# PMNS for efficiency and small memory cost

Contains a generator of low memory efficient PMNS and an efficient C codes generator.

The PMNS generator in the directory 'pmns_generator' is based on this work: PMNS for efficient arithmetic and small memory cost (to appear in Advances in IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 2022).
